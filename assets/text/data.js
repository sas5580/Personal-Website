	about: "Hi, my name is Saswata (pronounced shashota), and I'm a developer that wants to change the world through code, eventually. Since that's a little out of reach right now, I'm just doing my best to get there any way I can, starting with a Bachelors of Software Engineering  I am and always will be an avid learner, having tinkered with various areas of programming, such as android development, machine learning, databases and also intensely studied others such as web development, computer science and game design, but as a programmer, I realise that I havenâ€™t even scraped the surface of what modern technology has to offer.",

			name: "NEAT snake AI",

			description: "Developed with pure <b><i>Python3</i></b>, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a genetic algorithm for evolving a nerual network to perform a specific task. It alters weights and the structure of a neural network in a Darwinian manner and spits out the most fit contender. This library is able to train based on any numeraical inputs, outputs and a fitness function. <br> I decided to make it learn to play Snake, check it out below.",

			description: "Developed with <b><i>Python</i></b>, <b><i>React</i></b>, and <b><i>Android</i></b>, Scavenger Hunt is a geolocation game where one can create a game with locations as objectives through a web interface. Users can then join the game through our mobile App and compete with each other to see who can reach all the objectives first. All data storage and logic is administered by a <b><i>Flask</i></b> server, which handles all the requests from both the app and the website.",

The control the user has over the music as it is playing ranges from blocking specific amounts of the low frequencies all the way to the high frequencies and an parts in between. The program also has a graphical user interface using Python 2 that displays the levels of the frequencies of the music playing in real time.",

			description: "Developed primarily with <b><i>Python</i></b>, and also <b><i>HTML</i></b>, <b><i>CSS</i></b>, and <b><i>JavaScript</i></b> for the GUI, the Abstract Art Generator uses <b><i>PIL</i></b> (Python Image Library) to generate an image using an algorithm that generates the colour of each pixel randomly, yet in a pattern using trigonometric equations to create what looks a piece of art. The python code is served using python's <b><i>Flask</i></b> module. An example of what it can create can be seen, and used, below.",

			description: "Developed with <b><i>Java</i></b>, <b><i>XML</i></b>, and the <b><i>Estimote API</i></b>, LibEstimote is an Android app that introduces a new method for managing and browsing libraries. Its features include a built-in navigation system using Estimote beacons as indicators. Books from the section that the user is in will be displayed, along with directions to other sections. Users can also checkout books on the spot instead of checking out at a single area where queues can form. Simply scan the barcode of the desired book and it will be added to the users account. Overall, LibEstimote is an advanced library system which greatly enhances searching ability, accessibility and efficiency of libraries in general.",
